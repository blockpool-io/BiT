						<h2>Introduction</h2>
					</header>
					<p>
						BiT is a ReSTful JSON API that allows anyone to quickly and easily integrate their existing systems with the blockchain.
					</p>
					<p>
						Within these pages you can find documentation, simple code snippets and working examples to speed your integration and also help you understand the 
						scope and utility of BiT.

						<h2>How to use this guide</h2>
					</header>
					<p>
						There are three ways you can use BiT. This is explained in the section below. Within each section is a list of the functional
						"plugins" that are available. Just click through to the area you are interested in. The working samples integrate with the
						Blockpool test system.

					<h3 id="authenticated">BiT Authenticated</h3>
					<p>
						With BiT Authenticated the BiT is responsible for everything.
					</p>
					<p>
						It holds user details, manages and maintains passwords and will even act as an authentication engine for your own application, providing
						a JWT on login that you can use to decorate requests to BiT and also validate (using standard JWT) requests to your own API.
					</p>

					<h3 id="trusted">BiT Trusted</h3>
					<p>
						BiT Trusted is ideal if you already have authentication and want to integrate BiT seamlessly with your existing system.
					</p>
					<p>
						In this case your user provides their permission for BiT to trust your requests for resources that you have permission for. Once trust
						has been established between your user and us you will be able to act without asking again. Of course the user can revoke this
						trust and we encourage you to offer that option via your own interface though the user will always be able to use our own myBlockpool
						interface to do this.
					</p>

          <h3 id="paas">PaaS</h3>
          <p>
            PaaS is a very cut down implementation ideal if you do not want to give BiT any user information.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this case you do not provide any identifiable information for your customer to BiT at all; all authentication is carried out by
            your own application. It allows you to develop any technology you want on top of the blockchain, leaving you free to develop your IP without distraction.
          </p>
